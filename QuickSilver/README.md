Historically, lead has been the base metal associated with the art of printing, providing the structure and stability necessary to set up a mechanical printing press. In our electronic composition system, the creation, editing, and layout of text and artwork now flows in a manner analogous to the liquid metal Mercury. QuickSilver, a name implying speed and worth, is the Old English term for Mercury.

Traditional composition is broken down into distinct steps which include galley and artwork creation, page layout, and production of the ???nal masters. QuickSilver combines all of these steps into a single interactive system designed to provide simple, powerful, and exact tools for the composition of complex publications.

QuickSilver is powerful enough to allow a single person to produce an entire publication. The page elements can be created, edited, and laid out entirely within this system. However, the production of a publication usually involves many people with specialized areas of expertise. Text may be entered at word processing workstations by typists; artwork may be produced by graphic artists. These elements generated at other workstations, possibly at remote sites, can be input by QuickSilver over the Ethernet.

QuickSilver not only allows the input of elements generated elsewhere, but also provides sophisticated element editing functions. It is important to note that when modifications must be made to the form or content of elements, it is not necessary to return to the systems which originally generated them. This important feature greatly simplifies the publication production work 

QuickSilver also provides a comprehensive set of page layout functions which include the location and sizing of elements relative to one another. Once the boxes have been laid out, their contents can be input from ???les or can be entered directly and then edited. Two types of elements are currently implemented. The most important type is text in the form of body text, headings, and captions. The second is continuous tone artwork which is represented on the display screen and on the xerographic output with the use of digital halftoning techniques.

A xerographic proof copy may be obtained within seconds at any time during the composition process. In many cases, the quality of the proof is sufficient for use as camera ready copy.
